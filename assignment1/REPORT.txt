Question 1 - Anthony Castro(myself), Gene Tigner (medium) - Helped me get an understanding of what the assignment was requesting of me and general understanding of forking processes.  Mohammed R (small) - Attempted to explain my understanding of forking. 

Question 2 - Yes

Question 3 - Everything is working fine. 

Question 4 - Realized I did not know much about forking process and having zombies produced. I learned how to fork bomb my system. The assignment wasnâ€™t too hard it was more about grasping how parents relate to children. This was my first time using xcode to help me complete this project as well as I normally run on the fox machines.
